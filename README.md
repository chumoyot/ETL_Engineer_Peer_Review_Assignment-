# ETL_Engineer_Peer_Review_Assignment-
Demonstrates the ETL process [Extract Transform Load] 
It involved collecting data through an API provided by https://exchangeratesapi.io/, saving it as a dataframe and loading it to a csv file.
I then extracted the loaded csv file as a JSON, stored it in a dataframe, transformed it by changing column values from USD to GBP by using an exchange rates and renamed the dataframe column to reflect the changes.
I then loaded the transform into a final csv and finalized by writing a logging function.
